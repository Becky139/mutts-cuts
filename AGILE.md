### Reflections

Several false starts.
Got more comfortable using an Agile tool to plan functionality.  Applied retrospectively for the project creation objectives to practice how it works.
This was effectively the first iteration for the project before any real coding took place. After setting up and getting the inital deploy, I focused on building out part of the frontend.  The `home` app will contain the index page for the site.
The templates folder in the root directory contains the base.html *et al* templates.  From what I've learned so far different webpage components should be injected into each template.  Follow a modular/reusable/extension approach.  

In the background I continued researching models as I want to try to get these right 1st time.

Also it's useful to have some templates to link to models via views when the time comes.

TWIL (This week I learned) after creating a new project, cards can be dragged across from the add card area.
